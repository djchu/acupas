# DESCRIPTION
This package implements faster cutting algorithms for binary and multiclass linear SVM proposed in the following paper:

Dejun Chu, Changshui Zhang, Qing Tao, A faster cutting plane algorithm with accelerated line search for linear SVM, Pattern Recognition (2017), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.patcog.2017.02.006

# Compilation
On linux system, type 'make' to build the 'acupa' for binary linear SVM and 'acupam' for multiclass SVM.

# Usage
Syntax for binary case:
acupa [options] training_set_file testing_set_file

For multiclass case:
acupam [options] training_set_file testing_set_file

where data files are stored in SVM^{light} format.

This code is based on LIBOCAS tools. So the usage is similar to LIBOCAS in options, in which '-m 1' chooses OCAS solver while '-m 2' chooses ACUPA solver. 

## Contact
This package was developed by Dejun Chu (djun.chu@gmail.com). Due to limited number of tests performed, some bugs may still remain. Any suggestions, bug reports and improvements are welcome.
